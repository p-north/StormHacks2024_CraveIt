# Crave It! - Food Finder

**[Visit Site](https://crave-it-client.onrender.com/)**

**Crave It!** is a web app that helps you decide whether to cook or dine out by providing recipes based on cravings and ingredients, or by finding nearby restaurants tailored to your taste, budget, and location.

# Inspiration

We are beginners, and our teammate had a dilemma where he had to choose between eating in or dining out with friends, along with deciding what food he would eat based on each option.

# What it Does

Our web app helps users decide whether to cook or dine out by providing recipes based on cravings and available ingredients, or by finding nearby restaurants that match their craving, rating, budget, and location.

# How We Built It

We built the app using **React** for the front end, utilizing **Tailwind CSS** for stylish and responsive designs. Developed RESTful API endpoints with **Express.js** to integrate third-party APIs. We integrated **React Router** for seamless navigation between pages. Additionally, we used APIs like **Google Places** and **MealDB** to fetch restaurant and recipe data based on user preferences. The backend was implemented using JavaScript.

# Challenges We Ran Into

We encountered many challenges, from issues with retrieving data attributes from APIs to server problems. However, with trial and error, we solved most of these issues. Much thanks goes to the mentors who guided us along the way.

# Accomplishments That We're Proud Of

We made a web app! This is our first hackathon and our first time actually working with these tools and languages. We're proud that we set, planned, and achieved our goal.

# What We Learned

The software development experience was invaluable, giving us insight into what real-world development feels like. Beyond the technical skills, we also gained experience in teamwork and collaborating efficiently on a project.
